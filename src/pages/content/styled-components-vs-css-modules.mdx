# Styled Components vs Css Modules
### In React, we can use Css Modules to create reusable CSS classes. However, we can also use Styled Components. In this article, We will answer the question: Which one should I use?

### Technically, Css Modules transforms style names using a hash-based on the filename, path, style name. Styled Components handles styles in JS runtime, adding them as they go to the head HTML section of the page.

## Advantages of Styled Components

<ul>
<li>
## Reusable
### Just as the normal React components, you can make small reusable pieces of code and avoid code duplication. Typical use cases are buttons, tables, forms, etc.
</li>

<li>
  ## Writing pure CSS
  <h3>
    One of the biggest advantages of Styled Components in comparison to other
    styling solutions in React. You don’t to use weird syntax and write the CSS
    as a JavaScript object. Inside the template literals, you write SCSS or
    plain CSS. You also avoid the hassle with the media queries - it’s
    straightforward, just as classic CSS.
  </h3>
</li>

<li>
  ## Dynamic styling
  ###  By using props you can have dynamic values, which gives you a high level of flexibility by avoiding writing duplicated styles.
</li>

<li>
## Out-of-the-box theming support
### With ThemeProvider you can create a powerful theme-based architecture while maintaining full control over the styling in the individual component.
</li>

<li>
  ## No class name bugs
  ### Styled components generate unique class names for the defined styles. In this way, there is no duplication or unexpected overwriting.

</li>
<li>
## Better performance
### The library is smart enough to keep track of the components rendered on a page and not load the styling for unused components. In big application, this may have a big impact on the performance in comparison to the “old school” styling where you load all the styles at once.
</li>
<li>
## Nesting 
### You can use nested CSS in Styled Components.
</li>
</ul>

## Disadvantages of Styled Components

<ul>
<li>
## All in Head
### Css-in-js parses all the style definitions into plain vanilla CSS and put everything inside style tag in index.html file. This will increase html file size.
</li>
<li>
## Slow Rendering
### Browser will not start interpreting the styles until styled-components has parsed them and added them to the DOM, which slows down rendering.
</li>
</ul>

## Advantages of Css Modules

<ul>
<li>
## Update without worrying
### You can confidently update any CSS file without worrying about affecting other pages
</li>

<li>
  ## Random Css Classes
  ### Using Css Modules generates random CSS classes when displayed in the browser
</li>

<li>
  ## No class name bugs
  ### Css-in-js generates unique class names for the defined styles. In this way, there is no duplication or unexpected overwriting.
</li>
<li>
 ## Maintaniable Code
 ### Css Modules is easier to maintain and understand
</li>

<li>
## Performance
### Css Modules is performant and faster than Styled Components
</li>

<li>
## Easy usage with CSS Framewors
### Css Modules is easier to use with CSS Frameworks like Tailwindcss.
</li>



</ul>

## Disadvantages of Css Modules

<ul>

<li>
## Object
### You have to use styles object whenever constructing a className.
</li>

<li>
## Without Warning
### Reference to an undefined CSS Module resolves to undefined without a warning
</li>

<li>
## No nesting
### Css Modules is not allowed to use nesting you have to use scss or less for nesting
</li>
</ul>
