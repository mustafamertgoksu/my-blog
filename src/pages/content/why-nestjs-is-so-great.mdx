# Why Nestjs is so great

<ul>
<li>
## TypeScript
### Nestjs is a TypeScript based Node.js framework. This means that you can use static-type to write your code.
</li>
<li>
## Model view controller pattern
 ### Since ExpressJS doesn't follow MVC, there's no proper structure which makes the application inefficient and less optimized. NestJS becomes a better choice for developers as it is clearly based on an architecture with components like modules, controllers, and providers.
</li>
<li>
## Microservices
### Looking at the capabilities of an application, a microservice-based architecture has gained popularity in recent years. NestJS is a Node. JS framework based on ExpressJS, but it's more than that. In fact, NestJS gives you everything you need to create microservices easily.
